/**
 * This interface means the validation context (implemented by {@link ValidationImpl}) and can be
 * injected in your controller method. There are several types of violations that can occur: field
 * violations (on controller method fields), bean violations (on an injected beans field) or general
 * violations (deprecated). A controller using this validation can have violations on his parameters
 * or, if you use a injected data container like a DTO or bean, you may have violations inside this
 * object. possible to validate all controller parameters at once. If an error appears while
 * validating the controller method parameters, it results in a violation which you can get using
 * getFieldViolations(). If your injected bean contains violations, you should use
 * getBeanViolations().
